<h1>The Best Animes According to Matheus</h1>
<h2>My top three animes of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>FullMetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</h3>
<p>Best story ever, great plot and character development.</p>
<h3>Steins Gate</h3>
<p>Best sci-fi time travel plot of all-time.</p>
<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>The only way to not like this anime, is because you don't have a heart.</p>
